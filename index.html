Improved Accessibility
Using the new HTML5 elements to clearly describe our content makes it
easier for programs like screen readers to consume the content. A site's navigation,
for example, is much easier to find if you can look for the <nav> tag
instead of a specific <div> or unordered list. Footers, sidebars, and other
content can be easily reordered or skipped altogether. Parsing pages in general
becomes much less painful, which can lead to better experiences for
people relying on assistive technologies. In addition, new attributes on
elements can specify the roles of elements so that screen readers can work
with them more easily. In Chapter 5, Making Accessible Interfaces, on page
91, you’ll learn how to use those new attributes so that today’s screen readers
can use them.
Advanced Selectors
CSS3 has selectors that let you identify odd and even rows of tables, all
selected checkboxes, or even the last paragraph in a group. You can accomplish
more with less code and less markup. This also makes it much easier
to style HTML you can’t edit. In Chapter 4, Styling Content and Interfaces, on
page 67, you’ll see how to use these selectors effectively.
Visual Effects
Drop shadows on text and images help bring depth to a web page, and gradients
can also add dimension. CSS3 lets you add shadows and gradients to
elements without resorting to background images or extra markup. In addition,
you can use transformations to round corners or skew and rotate elements.
You’ll see how all of those things work in Chapter 8, Eye Candy, on page 151.
